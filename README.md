The code in this repository is used in my dissertation: "Error analysis of Joule heating calculations in the Upper Atmosphere from in-situ satellite measurements". It is implemented under the Daedalus project, a mission proposed to ESA for the Earth Observation programmeâ€™s 10th Earth Explorer. This work is used to demonstrate the effects of error in satellite measurements. Although, the data used do not come from in-situ measurements, but atmospheric models are used to simulate the measured data instead. The models used are the TIE-GCM (V2.0) and IGRF-12. More information about the Daedalus mission and the errors used can be found at the mission's web page: https://daedalus.earth.
In this repository two versions of the code can be found in the folders:
* `Joule Heating Error Propagation` (version 1)
* `Joule Heating Statistical Error` (version 2)

In the first version, the error propagation method is used to determine the systematic error, based on the errors proposed by the Daedalus team. The second version deals with random error or else refered as noise or statistical error. Both versions calculate some key ionospheric quantities, such as:
* Heating rates
* Collision frequencies
* Conductivities
* Currents and
* Cross sections
and also their errors. 
The output plots depict the quantities and errors as height, latitude-longitude and altitude-latitude depended.


## 








The version one corresponds to the error propagation analysis, while version two deals with random errors or else noise.
The data are not provided here beacause of large file sizes but anyone can request a run for the models in the links below:

* https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/requests/IT/TIE-GCM/tiegcm_user_registration.php

* http://www.geomag.bgs.ac.uk/data_service/models_compass/igrf_calc.html

In this case the data for the IGRF model where not request but imported with the pyglow library (including more atmospheric models), which can be found here: https://github.com/timduly4/pyglow.git
The operating system used is Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS. More prerequisites can be found at `requirements.txt`
