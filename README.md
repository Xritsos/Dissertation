The code in this repository is used in my dissertation: "Error analysis of Joule heating calculations in the Upper Atmosphere from in-situ satellite measurements". It is implemented under the Daedalus project, a mission proposed to ESA for the Earth Observation programmeâ€™s 10th Earth Explorer. The version one corresponds to the error propagation analysis, while version two deals with random errors or else noise. The measurements are simulated using data from the TIEGCM and IGRF models.
